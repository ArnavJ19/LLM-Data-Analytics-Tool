## Configuration

### OLLAMA Configuration
The app connects to OLLAMA running on `http://localhost:11434` by default. To change this:

1. Open `llm_insights.py`
2. Modify the `base_url` parameter in the `LLMInsightGenerator` class
3. Restart the application

### Model Selection
To use a different OLLAMA model:

1. Pull your desired model: `ollama pull <model-name>`
2. Update the `model_name` parameter in `llm_insights.py`
3. Restart the application

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "OLLAMA is not available" error:**
- Ensure OLLAMA is installed and running: `ollama serve`
- Check if the Qwen model is pulled: `ollama list`
- Verify the connection URL is correct

**2. File upload issues:**
- Ensure your file is in supported format (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- Check file encoding (UTF-8 recommended for CSV)
- Try with a smaller file first to test

**3. Visualization not showing:**
- Ensure Plotly is properly installed
- Check browser compatibility (modern browsers recommended)
- Clear browser cache and reload

**4. Memory issues with large datasets:**
- Try with smaller datasets first
- Close other applications to free memory
- Consider data sampling for very large files

### Performance Tips

- **Large datasets**: The app works best with datasets under 100MB
- **Many columns**: Performance may slow with >50 columns
- **Missing values**: High missing value percentages may affect analysis
- **Text data**: Very long text fields may need preprocessing
